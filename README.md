# AdventOfCode2021
The Advent of Code challenge is great way to practice problem solving, with every challenge being more difficult than the last one. 
Kudos to Eric Wastlhttp://was.tl/ for his work on this.

**This project is meant for practicing my Python coding skills.

Having practice my coding on the 2020 version with C# and having amazing time in doing so, although I only managed 22 stars :( 
I wanted to use this platform to practice other programming languages that I use every now and then.
Most of my work related coding is done in C#, but I use Python for some scripts, but those projects are usually small and far between.
Hence, I am using this years competition to practice my Python. 

I only ask of you, not to laugh to hard when you see some of the solutions I employ :)
I am more thinking of this as a way to practice and learn, rather than to optimize the code and finding the shortest path to a solution.
